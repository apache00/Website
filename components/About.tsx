      <p className="regular-16 pd-l-32 bg-white/80 text-gray-30 lg:mt-[30px] lg:bg-none">
      Our story begins when our forefather migrated from Hajipur, a city near Patna, to Muzaffarpur
to get some employment here. Since doing goldsmith work was in our blood, but due to
lack of own capital, they began with an artisan work. They began this work of
craftsmanship with a principle of fairness of business to everyone they do business
with. They also taught this principle to us. Since then we never looked back.
We, later successfully transformed into the modern and innovative jewellery maker. In
1996, we opened our first showroom with the name HIRA PANNA JEWELLERS in
Muzaffarpur, with the same principles which we learned from our forefather.
After few years of retailing we became a recognized name in MUZAFFARPUR jewellery
industry. Putting the art and purity of the jewel above all priorities, we are now jewellery
destination of choices, from a woman's every day wear to delicately crafted pieces for
the biggest day of her life. We deal in all assortments of hallmarked Gold Jewellery,
Silver Jewellery and Diamond Jewellery to suit the need of every budget. Our collection
includes industry renowned vogue jewellery. We employs individuals that are dedicated
towards their respective roles and put in a lot of effort to achieve the common vision and
larger goals of the company.
People here have always given jewellery a sacramental role in their custom and
tradition. Over decades, our designs have matched the tastes of those and since 1996,
they have kept their
trust in Hira Panna Jewellers to deliver jewels that are true to Indian culture.</p>
